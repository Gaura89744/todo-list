## 🔧 Features

- ➕ Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed (toggle by clicking on them)
- 🗑️ Delete tasks
- 💾 Persistent storage using `localStorage`
- ⚡ Instant UI updates without page refresh

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript 
- **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage

## 🚀 Run Locally

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gaura89744/todo-list.git
2.Open the project folder
   cd todo-list
   
3.Open index.html in your browser to start using the app.

⚙️ How It Works
When you add a task, it’s stored in the browser’s localStorage so it remains even after page refresh.
Clicking on a task toggles its completed state.
The Delete button removes the task permanently from both the UI and localStorage.

💡 Challenges Faced
Managing persistent storage without a backend
Handling event listeners for dynamically added tasks
Keeping the UI clean and user-friendly
